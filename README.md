# AFKReplace
A Plugin that kinda works like my [DCReplace Port](https://github.com/DatPanDat/PlayerReplace) but for AFK detection instead.

# Features
- Replaces a player with a random spectator if they haven't do anything for a while. With everything from inventories to status effects kept the same.
- If they're a 079, the replaced player will gets the correct EXP, AP, and the Room they were in.
- On the case of no replacement, their items and ragdoll will spawn with customizable reasons, and a broadcast to the server.
- Changing the broadcast message, AFK time, and roles to ignore in the config.

Code quite literally stolen again, this time from ["kingsplayground/Ultimate-AFK"](https://github.com/kingsplayground/Ultimate-AFK), still feel free to publicly shame me.

Special thanks to @UserNonExist for not suffering but since most of the code here is from PlayerReplace.

# Installation

**[EXILED](https://github.com/Exiled-Team/EXILED) must be installed for this to work.**
